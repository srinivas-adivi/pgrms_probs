#linewidth 30
#align center
#wrap on
This text will be processed by the text processor program.
Lines starting with # are commands to the text processor program.
For example this text will be wraped when length of the line is more than 30 charaters and each line is aligned to the center.

This is just the first version of the text processor.
In the later versions we will support many more features like paging, multiple columns etc.

#wrap off
Now i have switched off wrapping.
But align is still on.
So what ever you write here will be aligned but not wraped. 
You can write as big line as you wish, but it won't be wrapped.

#wrap on
#align right
Now its wrap is enabled again, but the text is going ot be aligned to the right.
I think you got how the text processor should work.

Good luck for your assignment.
